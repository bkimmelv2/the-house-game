// PLAN:
// Create a grid using for loop. Make each element an empty div with an id of (id="grid-" + i) and append to the main grid div.
// Add event listeners to the grid ids that I want something to happen in (clue, nonclue, joke, scary popup)
// Place a password textbox and submit button in front of all other elements. (must only accept a certain word)
// Add my main image and use absolute positioning to ensure the grid stays over the image.

// SIDE TASKS:
// Figure out how to make a how-to modal that pops up as the page loads. You then click the play button to make the modal disappear.
// Figure out how to play an audio file on loop.
